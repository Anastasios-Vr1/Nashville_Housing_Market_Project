This project focuses on data cleaning techniques using various SQL queries. The dataset used for this project contains over 56,000 rows of raw data on the Nashville housing market between 2013 and 2016.
In this project Iâ€™ve performed the following:

1.	Collected data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data)

2.	Imported the dataset into Microsoft SQL Server

3.	Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis

4.	Exported my code to GitHub for sharing and collaboration.

Now for the main part, cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, I have performed the following tasks:

1. Standardized the date format across all rows
 
2. Filled-in (populated) NULL values in certain columns to ensure that all data is complete and accurate
  
3. Split the addresses into separate columns for easier readability
  
4. Removed duplicate rows to ensure that the data is unique and accurate
  
5. Deleted unwanted columns that are not relevant to my analysis.
  
Through this process, I have gained valuable experience in applying data cleaning techniques to real-world data, and have prepared the dataset for further analysis. The final product is a clean and well-structured dataset that is ready for data analysis & exploration.
